		"DOTA_Archronicus_MadMoon_Page1"	"WHEN A WORLD was still a cooling blob, it captured an eerie companion—a glowing crystalline sphere that came to be known in lore as the Mad Moon. This small orb was full of violent radiance—a visual reminder of conflict in the heavens, bright enough to compete with the sun in daylight."
		
		"DOTA_Archronicus_MadMoon_Page2"	"But the Mad Moon was no inert rock. It was more truly a prison, in which two warring ancient intelligences had been captured and flung into exile aeons before, once the vast Primordials that underlay creation had tired of their endless strife. The punishment for these Ancients was to be locked together in one form, forever falling through infinity...and thus it went until our unfortunate world captured that wanderer. \n \nFor ages, primitive societies rose and fell beneath its weird glare; creatures of varying intelligence and sophistication gazed up in wonder and curiosity, to whatever extent their sentience allowed. Meanwhile, orbital stress and tidal forces allowed the Mad Moon's inhabitants to begin exploit what were at first the slightest of weaknesses, as they set to work prying open their prison. The cracks spread slowly, from the tiniest fractures, until at last there were millions of fissures, vast and aglow with weird energies."
		
		"DOTA_Archronicus_MadMoon_Page3" "On one apocalyptic night, the moon finally shattered, torn apart from within. Most of the moonstuff was flung into space or consumed as it hit the atmosphere. A few rare fragments fell to earth, either as fused molten lumps or as jagged crystals. The shards lay where they had fallen, and gradually the land around them recovered. As the survivors of the prehistoric cataclysm recuperated, flourished and developed civilizations, the Mad Moon became less a memory than a dream, with the night of its destruction woven into their myths."
		
		"DOTA_Archronicus_MadMoon_Page4" "The fallen shards of primal matter had fractured into their original composites: Radiant and Dire. In its pure form, each type of stone gave off a peculiar energy. For those who settled around the sites, they found themselves feeding on this unearthly power until they had not only harnessed the energy but made themselves dependent on it. They built shrines around the Ancients and revered them, ironically, as godlike entities that had fallen to earth.
The Ancients, both Radiant and Dire, provided many benefits: kinetic energy, mana, protection, even resurrection. But the emanations changed everything in their influence. Around the Radiant, the effects were bright and colorful, evoking lightness and charm. Around the Dire, a sinister radioactive glow, a visual seepage indicative of poison and decay. Neither force was neutral; they were both perfect complements and total contradictions that could never be at peace.
As each stone's cultural influence spread, it eventually came in conflict with the societies of its rival. Interference between the Ancients was cause for war, as the presence of one caused a corresponding fall-off in the energy of the other. Each stone could only be restored to full power with the destruction of its Foe-stone. And so the enthralled creatures rallied to protect their land by destroying the neighboring Ancient, and from far and wide the Heroes heard the call to battle and came to join, hardly realizing that in some sense both sides were the same."

Either by disease, or sword, the stories varied, but always it was spoken of two dragons dark blue in color and very much dead. \n  \nI set out immediately from my father's hold and found their scaly bodies charred on the property of a grain farmer three day's travel along the ridge road.  One great, one small, the dragons lay where they died, surrounded by the footprints of a much larger beast whose marks on the soil were large enough for a full grown keen to lie down in; and so I did, imagining the impossible scale of the animal in whose track I lay.  A grand dragon true, like the stories of old, and like some say still live in the southerly wastes. \n \nThe tracks crossed the land for some distance and ended where the beast took flight at the edge of the field.  So not by blade or pathosis had these young dragons met their end, but from an attack by one of their own kind. \n \nWith the good faith of my father's name, and a promise of immediate removal, I was able to purchase the rotting corpse of the lesser of the two dead dragons.  The specimen being nowhere near to full grown, I was able to drag it behind my trusty zonkey for several hours to my father's lands.  Several days of disarticulation and boiling commenced, followed by a full night's inurement in wax, until, at last, the entire skeleton was laid out before me in the great hall, available for study."
		
		"DOTA_Archronicus_ChronicleofThesos_Page4"	"Here I draw my observations with careful ink, noting the shape and size of every bone. \n  \nThe structure of the wing surprised me.  As did the curious architecture of the shoulder.  The bones themselves, though very strong, were much lighter than I had expected.  More like the bones of a bird than a creature of scales and teeth. \n  \nMost unexpected of all was the remnants of an old shield found in the beast's insides. But this one carried a most unusual form of gullet iron, and on it the mark of an ancient order seen only rarely in these parts today, a dragon crest, and the seal of the Scaled Knights of Uthorian.  Woe to the knight who carried it."

		"DOTA_Archronicus_TheSummoningSea_Page2"	" From whence the single frigate sailed, \n No soul still lives to dare recall, \n Brave voyage launched into the cold, \n Afraid of neither gale nor squall. \n \n To southern ice and wind they forged, \n The dauntless crew did plot their trek, \n In time the fields of floe and berg, \n Gave glimpse of land to all on deck. \n \n Upon an arctic shore they spied, \n Frost touched remains of monster vast, \n Old marks from briny wars they saw, \n And ice-locked teeth to dwarf their mast. \n \n On darkened beach was set a host, \n To excavate this mortal coil, \n Their picks and tools they lifted high, \n Then dug into their grisly toil."

		"DOTA_Archronicus_TheSummoningSea_Page7"	" Of fated crew's last port and call, \n No grey account still deigns to say, \n Some firm believe they made toward home, \n Though others tell of hangman's sway. \n \n Of gem and tidal deepgod's hunt, \n Vain quest goes on without reward, \n Its servants blindly come to shore, \n To kill and raze, be put to sword. \n \n For no thrall creature of the depths, \n Nor spirit bound in drowning's keep, \n Nor Maelrawn the Tentacular, \n Shall rest till seas, gem comes to sleep."

		"DOTA_Archronicus_CycleOfSolstices_Page1"						"On the longest night of the year, the dead do not always sleep.  For centuries, the learned aesthetes of Keyturn studied the skies from their mountain keep, where generation after generation, they tracked the movement of celestial bodies, copying down their arrangements in the great Book of Heavens. It was they who found the wheel of the world was a thing of many moving parts—a clock of strange rhythms and irregular meter.  It was they who counted the number of dawns in each season. It was they who calculated the day of longest night." 
		
		"DOTA_Archronicus_CycleOfSolstices_Page2"						"And it was they who first discovered the great cycle within the cycle—a periodic shift whereby in one solstice among many, the barrier between the planes wears thin, the aurora blazes green in the sky, and the undead rise from their graves. And it was they who were destroyed."
		
		"DOTA_Archronicus_CycleOfSolstices_Page3" 						"Now we have only fragments of their long studies.  The great Book of Heavens is lost to history, though copied remnants of certain passages are sometimes found in the ruins of ancient temples, or in the scholarly works of moldering libraries. These fragments are the last view into a lost civilization."

		"DOTA_Archronicus_WraithNight_Folio"						"- WRAITH-NIGHT -"
		
		"DOTA_Archronicus_WraithNight_Page1"						"Young prince Ostarion was thrust upon the throne by the death of his royal family. The swift, rotting disease that took their lives nearly claimed the prince as well, but the court's mage took desperate measures—submitting the youth to a ritual that pared away all the vulnerable flesh, transforming him into a being of animated bone. The young king emerged from the scouring, convinced that having defied death once, he would never submit to it."
		
		"DOTA_Archronicus_WraithNight_Page2a"						"With a deep mistrust of all things fleshy, Ostarion began to recast his parents' legacy in forms imperishable. Every stone of his kingdom was replaced with its equivalent in bone. Skeleton King's armies took dominion over neighboring lands, and as he extended his reach, he extracted the bones of his enemies. Eventually he came to rule over a land cold, white and brittle—and to yearn for something more."
		
		"DOTA_Archronicus_WraithNight_Page2b"						"Never having trusted flesh, nor wishing to clothe his bones in it, he finally settled on pursuit of wraith energy, a form of pure spirit given off by certain dark souls at death, and taken up by ghosts and other revenants when they need a form with which to walk the earth. Should he shape himself from the wraith essence, he thought he might create a body as luminous and eternal as his ego."
		
		"DOTA_Archronicus_WraithNight_Page3"						"Consulting the ancient mage who had saved the young prince's life, Skeleton King learned of a rare opportunity—a night foretold by certain olden sages who had grappled with the unruly and in most ways unpredictable cycles of nature—the solstice known as Wraith-Night, when the dead would rise in such great number that their souls could be harvested and captured in sufficient quantity to complete another ritual. Should he manage to harvest the wraith energy of the undead horde, he could rise once more transfigured—King forever, but this time of the Wraiths."
		
		"DOTA_Archronicus_WraithNight_Page4"						"From the Journals of Azorszos the Bony, Mage-Physik to Ostarion, eldest subject of that ungrateful wretch whom I must hail as king, and who will gladly lead the throng in cursing himself for the role he played in placing our so-called Skeleton King on the Throne of Bones."

		"map_lore_desc_0"					"High in the Wailing Mountains, the Aesthetes gather in reverie when the sacred wind blows.  At these times, the wheel-books sing of a great rift in the wholeness of existence—a disharmony sown from a single paradoxical thought conceived in the divine consciousness.  The Wailing One could not think this thought and be one being, and so the great unity was cloven.  What had been conjoined was rent asunder, and out of that great division the universe was born."

Yet the victor was granted no celebration or solace for their costly campaign.  As they mined into the earth they found only the treacherous graves of ancient lava tubes.  The rumors that sparked three kingdoms into bitter war had yielded nothing, and the price paid was enough to topple them all."

The slightest touch of flame will ignite these pools into an explosive blaze."

Ascetic and pragmatic, in their remote monastic eyrie they remained aloof from mundane strife, wrapped in meditation that knew no gods or elements of magic. Then came the Legion of the Dead God, crusaders with a sinister mandate to replace all local worship with their Unliving Lord's poisonous nihilosophy. From a landscape that had known nothing but blood and battle for a thousand years, they tore the souls and bones of countless fallen legions and pitched them against Turstarkuri. The monastery stood scarcely a fortnight against the assault, and the few monks who bothered to surface from their meditations believed the invaders were but demonic visions sent to distract them from meditation. They died where they sat on their silken cushions. Only one youth survived--a pilgrim who had come as an acolyte, seeking wisdom, but had yet to be admitted to the monastery. He watched in horror as the monks to whom he had served tea and nettles were first slaughtered, then raised to join the ranks of the Dead God's priesthood. With nothing but a few of Turstarkuri's prized dogmatic scrolls, he crept away to the comparative safety of other lands, swearing to obliterate not only the Dead God's magic users--but to put an end to magic altogether.

Over the years, its chains had corroded, along with its sanity; N'aix retained no memory of its former life and no longer dreamt of escape. Seeing a perfect vessel for his plans, the wizard wove a spell of Infestation and cast his life-force into N'aix's body, intending to compel N'aix to sacrifice itself in a frenzy of violence while the mage returned to his body and crept away unnoticed.

In that moment Lifestealer was born.

It pained her to leave the world bereft, for the sprouts had not yet broken through the soil--and they would be tender and vulnerable to every sort of harm. She found in her seed pouch one last seed that she had missed in the sowing. She spoke a single word into the seed and swallowed it as she fell. Her vast body decomposed throughout the long winter, becoming the humus that would feed the seedlings in the spring. And on the morning of the vernal equinox, before the rest of the forest had begun to wake, that last seed ripened and burst in an instant. From it stepped Nature's Prophet, in full leaf, strong and wise, possessing Verodicia's power to foresee where he would be needed most in defense of the green places--and any who might be fortunate enough to call him an ally."

But eventually he learned that he had been deluded... that bone itself could perish. Deeply mistrustful of flesh, he sought a more permanent way of extending his reign, and at last settled on pursuit of wraith energy, a form of pure spirit given off by certain dark souls at death. Should he infuse himself with Wraith Essence, he thought he might create a body as luminous and eternal as his ego. On the millennial solstice known as Wraith-Night, he submitted to a rite of transformation, compelling his subjects to harvest enough souls to fuel his ambition for immortality. No one knows how many of his champions died, for the only survivor who mattered was the Wraith King who rose with the sun on the following morn. Now he rarely spends a moment on his glowing throne--but strides out with sword drawn, demanding a fealty that extends far beyond death. "

In spirit, if not in physique, she might have been a Drow changeling, returned to her proper home. But as she grew, she towered above her family and came to think of herself as ugly. After all,  her features were smooth and symmetrical, entirely devoid of warts and coarse whiskers. Estranged from her adopted tribe, she withdrew to live alone in the woods. Lost travelers who find their way from the forest sometimes speak of an impossibly beautiful Ranger who peered at them from deep among the trees, then vanished like a dream before they could approach.

Strygwyr therefore goes out in search of carnage. The vital energy of any blood he lets, flows immediately to the Twins through the sacred markings on his weapons and armor. Over the years, he has come to embody the energy of a vicious hound; in battle he is savage as a jackal.

Placed with his kin in the vanguard of the final assault against the Dread Magus Vorn, the cost to his fellows was absolute. As the charging force battled toward the fortress, Azwraith alone among his kind remained standing, and he alone was able to infiltrate the keep. Focused and infuriated by the slaughter of his brothers, Azwraith bested each of the wizard's deadly traps and conjured guardians. Soon the simple fisherman arrived at Vorn's tower sanctum. The pair dueled through the night, pike to staff, as chaos raged below, and with a deafening cry Azwraith pierced his enemy. But the wizard did not simply expire; he exploded into uncountable shards of light, penetrating his killer with power. As the dust settled and the smoke of combat began to clear, Azwraith found himself standing among a throng of his kin. Each seemed to be dressed as he was, each seemed armed as he was, and he could sense that each thought as he did. Aware that his allies were approaching, he willed these phantoms to hide themselves, and one by one they began to vanish into nothingness. As the soldiers came upon the sanctum, they found the warrior that had bested the wizard. When they approached their champion, the lancer vanished. The pikeman who had stood before them was no more than another phantom."

Desperate, the Suicide-Mages of Cladd committed their ultimate rite, summoning a host of ancestral spirits to protect the fleet. Against the demons, this was just barely enough to turn the tide. As Kunkka watched the demons take his ships down one by one, he had the satisfaction of wearing away their fleet with his ancestral magic. But at the battle's peak, something in the clash of demons, men and atavistic spirits must have stirred a fourth power that had been slumbering in the depths. The waves rose up in towering spouts around the few remaining ships, and Maelrawn the Tentacular appeared amid the fray. His tendrils wove among the ships, drawing demon and human craft together, churning the water and wind into a raging chaos. What happened in the crucible of that storm, none may truly say. The Cataract roars off into the void, deserted by its former denizens. Kunkka is now The Admiral of but one ship, a ghostly rig which endlessly replays the final seconds of its destruction. Whether he died in that crash is anyone's guess. Not even Tidehunter, who summoned Maelrawn, knows for sure."

He bent himself to learning sorcery with the same thorough obsessiveness that marked his quest for incunabula, becoming the most powerful Warlock of the Academy in less time than most practitioners required to complete a course of undergraduate work.

The final rite, the rite of shades, is a harrowing spiritual journey through the Nothl Realm, an unpredictable domain from which not all visitants return.  Of those who do, some return mad. Others return with strange aptitudes. But all who go there are changed by their experiences. Driven by the need for enlightenment, Dazzle was the youngest of his tribe ever to request the sacred ritual. At first the order refused him, saying he was too young. But Dazzle was not to be dissuaded. Sensing something special in the headstrong young acolyte, the elders relented. Dazzle drank down the sacred potion and sat by the fire while the rest of his tribe danced through the night. In this ethereal dimension of the Nothl Realm, the properties of light and dark are inverted. Thus his brilliant healing light, beautiful to our eye, is actually a sinister kind of evil; and the darkest deeds are done in a dazzling glow. The elders' intuition was prophetic: Dazzle returned to his people as a Shadow Priest like none seen before, with the power to heal as well as to destroy. Now he uses his gift to cut down his enemies and mend his friends."

Always one step ahead of cheated customers, one town ahead of a pursuing patronage, the two trekked across the blighted lands until one day the con-man realized that the little youngling could actually do what he only pretended at. His ward had a gift--a gift that customers valued. And so the youngling Rhasta was thrust before the crowds, and the trade-name Shadow Shaman was born. The two continued from town to town, conjuring for money as Shadow Shaman's reputation grew.

A beast between the planes. 
There are stories that say he was once a great alchemist who tried to unlock the secrets of the universe and was cursed for his arrogance. Other legends tell that he is an ancient being of strange gravity, the abyss personified--a twisted voice from out the original darkness, before the first light in the universe.

On his day of summoning, when he was to gain full standing in his village, Sharpeye took the ancient test: a single shot from the valley floor to strike a beast down from the cliffs. To miss was to be dishonored. With his entire village standing vigil, Sharpeye took his shot. A steepstalker fell; the crowd cheered.  But when the carcass was collected, the village grew silent, for the elders found that the bullet had pierced its glittering central eye then fallen to be clenched in the steepstalker's mandibles. This ominous sign was the literal opening of a dark prophecy, foretelling both greatness and exile for the gunman who made such a shot. Sharpeye the Sniper was thus, by his own skill, condemned to make his way apart from his people--and unwelcome back among them until he has fulfilled the remainder of the prophecy by attaining legendary stature on a field of battle."

Afterward Karroch was indentured to the king's menagerie, where he grew up among all the beasts of the royal court: lions, apes, fell-deer, and things less known, things barely believed in. When the lad was seven, an explorer brought in a beast like none before seen. Dragged before the King in chains, the beast spoke, though its mouth moved not. Its words: a plea for freedom. The King only laughed and ordered the beast perform for his amusement; and when it refused, struck it with the Mad Scepter and ordered it dragged to the stocks. 
Over the coming months, the boy Karroch sneaked food and medicinal draughts to the wounded creature, but only managed to slow its deterioration. Wordlessly, the beast spoke to the boy, and over time their bond strengthened until the boy found he could hold up his end of a conversation.  He could, in fact, speak now to all the creatures of the King's menagerie. On the night the beast died, a rage came over the boy.  He incited the animals of the court to rebel and threw open their cages to set them amok on the palace grounds.  The Last King was mauled in the mayhem. In the chaos, one regal stag bowed to the boy who had freed him; and with Beastmaster astride him, leapt the high walls of the estate, and escaped.

Yet even in this toxic menagerie, Venomancer is acknowledged as the most venomous. Ages ago, an Herbalist named Lesale crossed the Bay of Fradj by coracle, searching for potent essences that might be extracted from bark and root, and found instead a nightmare transformation. Two leagues into Jidi's jungle, Lesale encountered a reptile camouflaged as an epiphyte, which stung him as he mistakenly plucked it. In desperation, he used his partial knowledge of the jungle's herbal bounty, mixing the venom of the (swiftly throttled) reptile with the nectar of an armored orchid, to compound an antidote. In the moments before a black paralysis claimed him completely, he injected himself by orchid-thorn, and instantly fell into a coma. Seventeen years later, something stirred in the spot where he had fallen, throwing off the years' accumulation of humus: Venomancer. Lesale the Herbalist no longer--but Lesale the Deathbringer. His mind was all but erased, and his flesh had been consumed and replaced by a new type of matter--one fusing the venom of the reptile with the poisonous integument of the orchid. Jidi's Acid Jungles knew a new master, one before whom even the most vicious predators soon learned to bow or burrow for their lives. The lurid isle proved too confining, and some human hunger deep in the heart of the Venomancer drove Lesale out in search of new poisons--and new deaths to bring."

But the ultimate price proved insufficient. Death disgorged her again and again, always holding back its deepest mysteries. Her jealousy grew. Others could die for eternity--why not she? Why must she alone be cast back on the shores of life with such tiresome regularity? Why was she not worthy of the one thing all other living creatures took for granted? Still, she would not be discouraged. Each time she returned from the grave, she brought a bit of death back with her. Wraiths followed her like fragments of her shattered soul; her blood grew thin and ectoplasmic; the feasting creatures of twilight took her for their kin.. She gave a little of her life with every demise, and it began to seem as if her end was in sight. With her dedication to death redoubled, and no client other than herself, Krobelus threw herself ever more fervently into death's abyss, intent on fulfilling the one prophecy that eluded her: That someday the Death Prophet would return from death no more."

From the moment of their master's death, the regents of the temple began rites of divination to identify their master's reincarnation, and eventually all signs converged on the immediate neighborhood. Several villages squatted in the shadow of the temple, their alleys and plazas full of the laughter of squalling children.  Pugna, a mere thirteen months of age, was but one candidate among the local brats, and on the appointed day he was presented at the temple alongside two other promising tots. The lamas offered a jumble of worn relics to the children, treasured possessions of their former grandmaster. One boy reached for a porphyry wand that had belonged to the lama...and put it in his nostril. An impish girl pulled out an amulet that had also been the lama's, and immediately swallowed it. Pugna regarded the other two coolly, gave a merry laugh, and blasted them with gouts of emerald flame, reducing them to ashes in an instant. He then snatched up the wand and amulet, saying 'Mine!' The regents hoisted the beaming Pugna on their shoulders, wrapped him in their grandmaster's vestments, and rushed him to the throne before his mood could change. Within five years, the temple itself was another pile of ash, which pleased Pugna to no end."

Already quiet and secretive by nature, the difficulty of acquiring these objects further reinforced her skills of stealth. Had she been less retiring, she might have become notorious among the guilds as a thief-scholar. Instead her investigations led her into far more obscure corners. As she devoted her furtive talents to unlocking the secrets of the universe, she instead unlocked a secret door that exists in nature itself: the entryway to the most Hidden Temple. The intelligences that waited beyond that portal, proved to be expecting her, and whatever mysteries they revealed in the moment of their discovery was nothing compared to the answers they held out to Lanaya should she continue in their service. She swore to protect the mysteries, but more to the point, in service to the Hidden Temple she satisfies her endless craving for understanding.

As she stood at the edge of an ancient forest, a pair of glowing eyes spied on from an elder branch.  Something beautiful and deadly sought a meal in the wilting dusk.  Without a sound, it turned and left.  Fury overtook her.  Clutching a rust-eaten dagger, she charged after the beast determined to reclaim even a shred of her past glory, but her quarry would not be caught.  Three times she cornered the creature among the rocks and trees, and three times she pounced only to witness its fading shadow darting further into the woods.  Yet the full moon shone brightly, and the creature's trail was easy to follow.  Arriving in a clearing atop a high hill, the beast's massive feline form sat in the open, attentive and waiting.  When the woman brandished her dagger, the creature reared and roared and charged.  Death, it seemed, had come for her at long last in this strange place.  She stood, calm and ready.  A flash of movement, and the beast snatched the dagger from her hand before vanishing into the forest.  Stillness.  Hooded figures approached. In reverent tones they revealed that Selemene, Goddess of the Moon, had chosen her, had guided her, had tested her. Unwittingly she had endured the sacred rites of the Dark Moon, warriors of the Nightsilver Woods.
She was offered a choice: join the Dark Moon and pledge herself to the service of Selemene, or leave and never return. She did not hesitate. Embracing her absolution, she renounced her bloody past, and took up a new mantle as Luna of the Dark Moon, the dreaded Moon Rider, ruthless and ever-loyal guardian of the Nightsilver Woods."

As their blood mingled, Slyrak sent his power out along the Blood Route, sending all its strength and centuries of wisdom to the knight.  The dragon's death sealed their bond and Dragon Knight was born. The ancient power slumbers in the Dragon Knight Davion, waking when he calls it.

He had spent his entire life in the service of the Omniscience, the All Seeing One. Theirs was a holy struggle, and so embedded was he in his duty that he never questioned it so long as he had the strength to fight and the impetuous valor that comes with youth. But over the long years of the crusade, as his elders passed away and were buried in sorry graves at the side of muddy tracks, as his bond-brothers fell in battle to uncouth creatures that refused to bow to the Omniscience, as his own squires were chewed away by ambush and plague and bad water, he began to question the meaning of his vows--the meaning of the whole crusade. After deep meditation, he parted ways with his army and commenced a long trek back to the cave-riddled cliffs of Emauracus, and there he set a challenge to the priests of the Omniscience. No knight had ever questioned them before, and they tried to throw him into the pit of sacrifice, but Purist would not be moved. For as he faced them down, he began to glow with a holy light, and they saw that the Omniscience had chosen to reveal Itself to him. The Elder Hierophant led him on a journey of weeks down into the deepest chamber, the holy of holies, where waited not some abstract concept of wisdom and insight, not some carved relic requiring an injection of imagination to believe in, but the old one itself. It had not merely dwelt in those rocks for billions of aeons; no, It had created them. The Omniscience had formed the immense mineral shell of the planet around itself, as a defense against the numerous terrors of space. Thus the All Seeing One claimed to have created the world, and given the other truths revealed to Purist on that day, the knight had no reason to refute the story. Perhaps the Omniscience is a liar, deep in its prison of stone, and not the world's creator at all, but Omniknight never again questioned his faith. His campaign had meaning at last. And there can be no question that the glorious powers that imbue him, and give his companions such strength in battle, are real beyond any doubt."

No longer at the mercy of a mortal body, his very lifeblood became a source of incredible power; every drop spilled was returned tenfold with a fierce, burning energy. However this newfound gift infuriated Huskar, for in his rescue from the Nothl, Dazzle had denied him a place among the gods. He had been denied his own holy sacrifice. In time the elders of the order sought to expand their influence and Huskar, they agreed, would be a formidable tool in their campaign. Yet becoming a mere weapon for the order that denied him his birthright only upset him further. As the first embers of war appeared on the horizon, he fled his ancestral home to find new allies, all the while seeking a cause worthy of unleashing the power his total sacrifice could bring."

Skitskurr was a master Weaver, charged with keeping one small patch of creation tightly woven and unfaded. But the job was not enough to satisfy. It nagged him that the original work of creation all lay in the past; the Loom had done its work and travelled on. He wanted to create rather than merely maintain--to weave worlds of his own devising.  He began making small changes to his domain, but the thrill of creation proved addictive, and his strokes became bolder, pulling against the pattern that the Loom had woven. The guardians came, with their scissors, and Weaver's world was pared off, snipped from the cosmic tapestry, which they rewove without him in it. Skitskurr found himself alone, apart from his kind, a state that would have been torment for any other Weaver. But Skitskurr rejoiced, for now he was free. Free to create for himself, to begin anew. The raw materials he needed to weave a new reality were all around him. All he had to do was tear apart this old world at the seams."

In the vicious battle that followed, Chen's clan was outmatched.  The armored Knights of the Fold made short work of the enthralled locuthi, who attacked and died in waves.  With their dragons dead, the tribesmen followed. Chen struggled, and slashed, and clawed, and perished--or would have. Defeated, on his knees, he faced his execution with humility, offering his neck to the blade. Moved by Chen's obvious courage, the executioner halted his sword. Instead of the blade, Chen was given a choice: death or conversion. Chen took to the faith with a ferocity. He joined the Fold and earned his armor one bloody conversion at a time.

But in addition to a few trinkets and his considerable pension, the erstwhile engineer left with something far more interesting: a long-forgotten, incomplete schematic for a Gyrocopter, the world's first manned, non-magical flying device. Retiring to the tropical obscurity of the Ash Archipelago with little else but time and money, he set to work building the device. As the years wore on and the remains of failed prototypes began to pile up, he began to wonder if mechanical flight was even possible. A decade and a day after his retirement, on a sunny afternoon with a southerly breeze, Aurel sat in his latest attempt bristling with indignation and expectant failure. With a grunt of effort he pulled the ignition cord and covered his head, waiting for the inevitable explosion. However to his great surprise he began to lift and, following a few panicked adjustments, stabilize. Within an hour, he was ducking and weaving with the breeze, level with the gulls, and Aurel found himself filled with the breathless wonder of flight. As dusk settled in he set a course back to his workshop, but no sooner had he turned his craft when a cannonball tore through his tailfin. Disentangling himself from the wreckage, he swam toward the nearest piece of land in sight, and cursed to see the ship responsible for the cannonball collecting the debris. Days later, when Aurel returned to his workshop, he set to work on yet another gyrocopter, this one capable of carrying a much heavier, more dangerous payload."

However, when adulthood came calling he pushed aside the family trade to try his hand at manufacturing gold through Alchemy. In an act of audacity befitting his reputation, Razzil announced he would transmute an entire mountain into gold. Following two decades of research and spending and preparation, he failed spectacularly, quickly finding himself imprisoned for the widespread destruction his experiment wrought. Yet Razzil was never one to take a setback lightly, and sought escape to continue his research. When his new cellmate turned out to be a fierce ogre, he found just the opportunity he needed. After convincing the ogre not to eat him, Razzil set about carefully concocting a tincture for it to drink, made from the moulds and mosses growing in the prison stone work. In a week's time, it seemed ready. When the ogre drank the potion, it flew into an unstoppable berserker rage, destroying the cell bars and exploding through walls and guards alike. They soon found themselves lost somewhere in the forest surrounding the city with a trail of wreckage in their wake and no signs of pursuit.  In the tonic's afterglow, the ogre seemed serene, happy, and even eager. Resolving to work together, the pair set off to collect the materials needed to attempt Razzil's Alchemic transmutation once more."

		"npc_dota_hero_invoker_bio"													"In its earliest, and some would say most potent form, magic was primarily the art of memory. It required no technology, no wands or appurtenances other than the mind of the magician. All the trappings of ritual were merely mnemonic devices, meant to allow the practitioner to recall in rich detail the specific mental formulae that unlocked a spell's power. The greatest mages in those days were the ones blessed with the greatest memories, and yet so complex were the invocations that all wizards were forced to specialize. The most devoted might hope in a lifetime to have adequate recollection of three spells--four at most. Ordinary wizards were content to know two, and it was not uncommon for a village mage to know only one--with even that requiring him to consult grimoires as an aid against forgetfulness on the rare occasions when he might be called to use it. But among these early practitioners there was one exception, a genius of vast intellect and prodigious memory who came to be known as the Invoker. In his youth, the precocious wizard mastered not four, not five, not even seven incantations: He could command no fewer than ten spells, and cast them instantly. Many more he learned but found useless, and would practice once then purge from his mind forever, to make room for more practical invocations. One such spell was the Sempiternal Cantrap--a longevity spell of such power that those who cast it in the world's first days are among us still (unless they have been crushed to atoms). Most of these quasi-immortals live quietly, afraid to admit their secret: But Invoker is not one to keep his gifts hidden. He is ancient, learned beyond all others, and his mind somehow still has space to contain an immense sense of his own worth...as well as the Invocations with which he amuses himself through the long slow twilight of the world's dying days."

Raised with other young mages in a hidden cantonment among the hills of the Hazhadal barrens, the order's preceptors waited for Nortrom's abilities to manifest. While the other students honed their talents with fire, or ice, or incantatory spells, Nortrom sat silent and talentless, unable to cast so much as a hex. As the day of final testing approached, he still hadn't found his magic. In disgust, the preceptors berated him, while the children laughed. \"You are no mage,\" the head of the order declared. Still, Nortrom did not slink away. He entered the day of testing and faced down the young mages who had mocked him. And then his preceptors learned a valuable lesson: a lack of magic can be the greatest magic of all. Nortrom silenced the young mages one by one and defeated them in single combat, until he alone stood as champion of the Aeol Drias, in fulfillment of the prophecy."

With his whole being focused on his vigil, Outworld Devourer paid little attention to events closer in to the sun. But at last the clamor of the Ancients, and a sense of growing threat from within as well as without, sent him winging sunward to visit the plains of war.

No longer willing to pay homage and fealty, they instead sent six-thousand swords into the capital, where they were wiped out in the Massacre of the Apostates. And then came the teeth behind the old truth: When you strike a king's neck, you had better take his head. Enraged by the betrayal, the king exterminated the vast Ambry bloodline, sparing only the lord of the house and his youngest son, Banehallow. Before all the royal court, with the disgraced lord chained to the ornate marble floor, the King bade his magicians transform the boy into a wolf so that he might tear out his own father's throat. \"Do this,\" the king said, \"so that Lord Ambry will understand the bite of betrayal.\" Powerful magic was invoked, and the child was transformed. But though his body was changed, his spirit remained intact, and instead of biting the exposed neck of his father, he attacked his handlers, tearing them to pieces. A dozen of the King's knights perished under the wolf's teeth before they managed to drive it off into the night. Lord Ambry laughed from his chains even as the King ran him through with a sword. Now the heir to the lost house of Ambry, Banehallow wanders the trail as the Lycan, part warrior, part wolf, in search of justice for all that he lost."

Wise old Sylla, clan justiciar and seer, stepped forward for his kin, and to him was given the Seed with these words: 'When all of the world has dimmed, when civilization has left these lands, when the world is slain and wracked by the endless deserts at the end of ages, plant the Seed.' As he grasped his trust, Sylla felt his years recede and his vitality returned. Vast knowledge burst into his mind. He found himself able to project his very will into reality and, with some concentration, alter his own physical form as well. Yet subtle whispers and cruel ears brought word of the Seed and its power to other peoples, and a terrible war crashed upon the Bear Clan. As his ancestral home burned, Sylla took his burden and fled to the wild places. Ages passed, and time and myth forgot the Bear Clan, forgot Sylla and the Seed, forgot wondrous civilizations that rose and fell in Bear Clan's wake. For millenia Sylla has waited, waited for word from his deities, waited for peace to come to the ever warring realms, waited in exile and in secret for the end of all things and for the conclusion of his sacred commitment, preparing himself always to face and destroy whatever would dare threaten his purpose."

The Shadow Demon, however, has always taken a deep and abiding interest in the material plane, as if sensing that mastery of this gritty dimensional nexus might be the key to total domination of all realities. Summoned first by minor wizards, the Shadow Demon granted every wish and put on increasingly impressive displays of power until he had the full attention of the greatest demonologists, and through them the various lords, tyrants, autarchs and heirophants who depended on sorcery to buttress their mundane power. So great was his deception that all his summoners considered themselves the master and Shadow Demon the servant; meanwhile, he eroded their identities and made their minds his own. In the end, most members of the cult were hollow puppets, extensions of his evil will. What Shadow Demon's next step would have been remains open to speculation, for around this time, Nevermore the Shadow Fiend bit into a particularly nasty-tasting soul and discovered that it held nothing but a foul nougat of Shadow Demon's essence. Alerted that a coup was underway, and that the ancient equilibrium of the Umbral Pact was about to be destabilized, Doom and Shadow Fiend briefly joined forces to destroy the burgeoning cult. Combining spells of incredible force, they undid Shadow Demon's centuries of patient work, reducing his cult to smithereens--and all its members to a bloody splatter. Nothing remained except a tiny speck of demon shadow. Immortal and irreducible, this mote of evil was enough to seed the Shadow Demon's next scheme, and in fits and starts, over further centuries, he began to regroup. Whatever that speck of shadow touched, it tainted, and its influence gradually grew. A chaos of damaged parts pulled together, reknit, and combined to give Shadow Demon a form even stronger than his former. He is all but complete now, and his plan for infinite dominion lacks all of its former weaknesses. It would seem that such a being of pure malice and malevolence, a threat to all creation, would be forever out of place in our world...yet Shadow Demon does not lack for followers. "

However, once every generation or so, the ogre race is blessed with the birth of a two-headed Ogre Magi, who is immediately given the traditional name of Aggron Stonebreak, the name of the first and perhaps only wise ogre in their line's history. With two heads, Ogre Magi finds it possible to function at a level most other creatures manage with one. And while the Ogre Magi will win no debates (even with itself), it is graced with a divine quality known as Dumb Luck--a propensity for serendipitous strokes of fortune which have allowed the ogre race to flourish in spite of enemies, harsh weather, and an inability to feed itself.

There came and went an age of questions and of doubts, a thousand summers of long traditions set to scrutiny, while more and more the outsiders died and fed their earth. When all that bloomed had finally finished their say, curiosity had overcome caution.

Thought left them. Sanity left them. Hunger, however, did not. They turned on each other with split fingernails and shattered teeth. Then it came: distant at first, a fragile note at the edge of perception, joined by another, then another, inescapable and unending. The chorus grew into a living wall of sound pulsing in his mind until no other thought survived. With the Dirge consuming him, he opened his arms to the Dead God and welcomed his obliteration. Yet destruction was not what he'd been chosen for. The Dead God demanded war. In the belly of the great nothing, he was granted a new purpose: to spread the Dirge across the land, to rally the sleepless dead against the living. He was to become the Undying, the herald of the Dead God, to rise and fall and rise again whenever his body failed him. To trudge on through death unending, that the Dirge might never end."

Already a renowned duelist and scholar of the grander world of sorcery, it had never occurred to Rubick that he might perhaps be Magus material until he was in the midst of his seventh assassination attempt. As he casually tossed the twelfth of a string of would-be killers from a high balcony, it dawned on him how utterly unimaginative the attempts on his life had become. Where once the interruption of a fingersnap or firehand might have put a cheerful spring in his step, it had all become so very predictable. He craved greater competition. Therefore, donning his combat mask, he did what any wizard seeking to ascend the ranks would do: he announced his intention to kill a Magus.
Rubick quickly discovered that to threaten one Magus is to threaten them all, and they fell upon him in force. Each antagonist's spell was an unstoppable torrent of energy, and every attack a calculated killing blow. But very soon something occurred that Rubick's foes found unexpected: their arts appeared to turn against them. Inside the magic maelstrom, Rubick chuckled, subtly reading and replicating the powers of one in order to cast it against another, sowing chaos among those who had allied against him. Accusations of betrayal began to fly, and soon the sorcerers turned one upon another without suspecting who was behind their undoing.
When the battle finally drew to a close, all were singed and frozen, soaked and cut and pierced. More than one lay dead by an ally's craft. Rubick stood apart, sore but delighted in the week's festivities. None had the strength to argue when he presented his petition of assumption to the Hidden Council, and the Insubstantial Eleven agreed as one to grant him the title of Grand Magus."

Constantly under assault from both seasonal storms and encroachment from civilized kingdoms to the South, the upland Oglodi have for centuries struggled to subsist atop the endless tablelands.  They are the fractured remnant of a once-great civilization, a fallen tribe, their stormcraft strange and inscrutable, cobbled together from scraps of lost knowledge which even they no longer fully understand.  For those on the high plain, weather has become a kind of religion, worshiped as both the giver and taker of life.  But the electrical storms that bring life-sustaining rains arrive at a cost, and many are the charred and smoking corpses left in their wake.  
Although small for his kind, Disruptor is fearless, and driven by an insatiable curiosity.  As a youth, while still unblooded and without a stryder, he explored the ruins of the ancestral cities, searching through collapsed and long-moldering libraries, rummaging through rusting manufactories.  He took what he needed and returned to his tribe.  Adapting a coil of ancient design, he harnessed the power of electrical differential and now calls down the thunder whenever he wishes.  Part magic, part craftsmanship, his coils hold in their glowing plates the power of life and death--a power wielded with precision against the landed castes to the South, and any interlopers who cross into ancient Oglodi lands."

Unlike most grubs of his colony, Nyx Assassin did not arise from metamorphosis with the plodding thoughts and blunted appendages common to the worker caste of his kind. For his was a special transformation, guided by the grace of Nyx.  He was the chosen one, selected from the many and anointed with an extract of the queen goddess herself.  Not all survive the dark blessing of the queen's chamber, but he emerged with a penetrating mind, and dagger-like claws--his razor sharp mandibles raking the air while his thoughts projected directly into the minds of those around him.  Of all zealot scarabs, he alone was selected for the highest calling.  After his metamorphosis, he was reborn, by grace of Nyx, with abilities which shaped him for one thing and one thing only: to kill in the name of his goddess."

Once most highly esteemed of her race, Slithice for many years commanded a battalion of her fellows, using her formidable voice as her greatest weapon.  Powerful, sinuous, serpentine, she led her deadly Guard in defense of the Deep Ones, and the great wealth of the sunken cities.  But in the final battle of Crey, her forces were driven back by a marauding army of levianths intent on finding tribute for their god Maelrawn.  After the long and bloody onslaught, as the bodies were cleared from the sunken halls, a single jeweled chalice was found missing from the trove.  Of her hundred Guard, only a handful survived, but their bravery and sacrifice were of little consequence.  What mattered was that treasure was taken.  Honor destroyed.  And so Naga Siren was cast out.  Banished to search for the stolen chalice.  Though she might add a hundred times her weight to the golden trove, she is doomed to live apart until that day she returns that which was taken.  For no amount of gold is equal in honor to the honor she lost."

It is a razor barbed warren full of murderous slithereen, treacherous Deep Ones, sociopathic meranths. In this dim labyrinth, patrolled by eels and guarded by enormous anemones, only the vicious survive. Pitched into Dark Reef for crimes unknown, Slark spent half a lifetime without kin or kindness, trusting no one, surviving through a combination of stealth and ruthlessness, keeping his thoughts and his plans to himself. When the infamous Dark Reef Dozen plotted their ill-fated breakout, they kept their plans a perfect secret, murdering anyone who could have put the pieces together--but somehow Slark discovered their scheme and made a place for himself in it. Ten of the Dozen died in the escape attempt, and two were captured, hauled back to Dark Reef, then executed for the entertainment of their fellow inmates. But Slark, the unsung thirteenth, used the commotion as cover and slipped away, never to be caught. Now a furtive resident of the carnivorous mangrove scrub that grips the southern reach of Shadeshore, Slark remains the only successful escapee from Dark Reef."

One of the invaders seized Medusa as well, but then cast her aside with a disgusted look: 'This one has the mortal stink upon her. We have no use for that which dies.' Humiliated, enraged, Medusa fled to the temple of her mother and cast herself before the goddess, crying, 'You denied me eternal life--therefore I beg you, give me power! Power, so I can dedicate what life I have to rescuing my sisters and avenging this injustice!'

As much as trolls love to argue, imagine how rare it is for a troll to be driven from his own kind for being too difficult to get along with. Such was Jah'rakal's fate, a monger troll from deep in the Hoven. So deluded was he, so bitter and abrasive, that even other trolls found his company intolerable. After one particularly vitriolic outburst in which he claimed the lion's share of loot from their latest raid, his cohorts finally snapped. They turned on him, beat him with clubs, and drove him from the encampment. Enraged at his banishment, he returned the next day, armed with steel, and slew them all, one by one. He then swore a blood oath: he would ever after be a fighting force unto himself. Now he roams the world as the Troll Warlord, bitter and angry, the Imperial high commander of an army of one."

For centaurs, combat is the perfect articulation of thought, the highest expression of self.  If killing is an art among centaurs, then Bradwarden the Warrunner is their greatest artist.  He rose to dominance on the proving grounds of Omexe, an ancient arena where centaur clans have for millennia gathered to perform their gladiatorial rites.  As his fame spread, spectators came from far and wide to see the great centaur in action.  Always the first to step into the arena, and the last to leave, he composes a masterpiece in each guttering spray, each thrust of blood-slickened blade-length.  It is the poetry of blood on steel, flung in complex patterns across the pale sands of the killing floor.
Warrunner defeated warrior after warrior, until the arena boomed with the cheering of his name, and he found himself alone, the uncontested champion of his kind.  The great belt of Omexe was bestowed, wrapped around his broad torso, but in his victory, the death-artist found only emptiness.  For what is a warrior without a challenge?  The great centaur galloped out of Omexe that day with a new goal.  To his people, Warrunner is the greatest warrior to ever step into the arena.

The survivors pushed north, until they reached a blockade watched over by a hundred hunters armed with bow and steel. Magnus expected no less.

Sleep eluded him; he only built.  Months had passed since he had shut himself in his uncle's workshop, and his deliverance was nearly complete.  He rubbed his back as his eyes drifted shut, and saw a blanket of flowers floating on the placid waves of Augury Bay before exploding into a cloud of pollen that silenced lives as it seized the lungs.  He woke with a choking start.  For hours the rhythmic sound of a whetstone filled the shop as he sharpened a set of massive blades, his mind filled with images of strangling vines garroting neighbors, enwrapping homes.  The flooding of Augury Bay had been nothing compared to the violent horrors the waters left to take root beyond the city walls.  But the saw-suit would make him strong and safe he thought, allowing himself this sliver of hope before the full might of his fear crashed into his fading mind.  Branches and bark and blood.  When the city fell, Rizzrack fled trees that walked, and fought, and killed.  Trees had shattered the gates and swarmed into the city.  Trees had crushed and thrashed and stomped the last that Augury Bay could muster in defense, and stalked the few fleeing refugees.  In addled silence Rizzrack unspooled the thick chain from the suit's arm, his hands quaking as he inspected each link and ran a trembling finger along the claw attached at its end.  The saw-suit was ready.
With his hand trembling he sparked the bladed machine to life.  Terror drove him, terror of what awaited him and of what he would have to face to have any hope of calming his mind.  As the saw-suit shuddered to life he knew he must face this fear, and he knew he wouldn't like it one bit."

For a bit of brew, Bristleback was hired to collect tabs, keep the peace, and break the occasional leg or two (or five, in the case of one unfortunate web-hund).
After indulging in a night of merriment during which bodily harm was meted out in equal parts upon both delinquent patrons and his own liver, Bristleback finally met his match. \"Your tusks offend me, sir,\" he was heard to drunkenly slur to one particularly large fellow from the northern wastes whose bill had come due. What followed was a fight for the ages. A dozen fighters jumped in. No stool was left unbroken, and in the end, the impossible happened: the tab went unpaid. Over the weeks that followed, Bristleback's wounds healed, and his quills grew back; but an enforcer's honor can be a prickly thing. He paid the tab from his own coin, vowing to track down this northerner and extract redemption. And then he did something he'd never done before: he actually trained, and in so doing made a startling discovery about himself. A smile peeled back from his teeth as he flexed his quills.

As skilled as he was, Ymir had never taken part in a real battle, never tested himself against the indiscriminate death and chaos of war.

They grow up believing themselves fierce protectors of their lineal traditions, the customs of the realm--but what they really are protecting is the Font itself. And the motives of the mist are unclear.
		When the infant Abaddon was bathed in the Font, they say something went awry. In the child's eyes there flared a light of comprehension that startled all present and set the sacerdotes to whispering. He was raised with every expectation of following the path all scions of Avernus took--to train in war, that in times of need he might lead the family's army in defense of the ancestral lands. But Abaddon was always one apart. Where others trained with weapons, he bent himself to meditation in the presence of the mist. He drank deep from the vapors that welled from the Font, learning to blend his spirit with the potency that flowed from far beneath the House; he became a creature of the black mist.
		There was bitterness within the House Avernus--elders and young alike accusing him of neglecting his responsibilities. But all such accusations stopped when Abaddon rode into battle, and they saw how the powers of the mist had given him mastery over life and death beyond those of any lord the House had ever known."

		These original progenitors were there near the Beginning--if not actual witnesses to the creation, then born with it still echoing in their ears. Stamped with the earliest energies of the universe, they wished nothing more than to continue as creators themselves. Thus they bent to the task of shaping matter to their will: hammering and heating, bending and blasting. And when matter proved less challenging than they liked, they turned their tools upon themselves, reshaping their minds and reforging their spirits until they had become beings of great endurance. Reality itself became the ultimate object of their smithing. Yet, along the way, they sometimes erred. In cases of great ambition, mistakes are unavoidable.
		The one we know as the Elder Titan was a great innovator, one who studied at the forge of creation. In honing his skills, he shattered something that could never be repaired, only thrown aside. He fell into his own broken world, a shattered soul himself. There he dwelt among the jagged shards and fissured planes, along with other lost fragments that had sifted down through the cracks in the early universe. And this is why the world we know resembles an isle of castaways, survivors of a wreck now long forgotten. Forgotten, that is, by all but the One who blames himself. He spends his time forever seeking a way to accomplish the repairs, that he might rejoin the parts of his broken soul, that we and the world alike might all be mended. This is the One we know as Elder Titan."

Within the city walls of Stonehall there came a rumble and a terrible sound, and from blackness unknown came a force of beasts numbering beyond count, wielding flame and foul sorcery, slaying and snatching mothers and sons to dark purpose. Of once-mighty Stonehall's military strength only the Bronze Legion, led by the indomitable Commander Tresdin, was near enough to answer the call of battle. They rode into their city, fighting through bloodstained alleyways and burning markets, cutting their way through the monstrous throng to the source of the sudden invasion: an ethereal rift within the city square, and at its precipice thundered their dreaded champion.
Enwrapped in a corrosive shimmer, the leader of the abyssal horde swung its massive blade, cleaving a legionnaire in two as his flesh began to spoil. Tresdin lifted her blood-stained sword and settled her sights on the beast. It turned, smiling at her through a maze of teeth. Heedless of the battle raging around them, they charged one another.
Deflecting blow after blow, the pair danced their deadly duel as the Bronze Legion met its end around them. Tresdin leapt forward as her foe swung its sword to meet her. The odds turned. The attack smashed into Tresdin suddenly, a brutal thrust from the side, but even as her balance slipped she rallied her strength for another stroke. Blade scraped on blade, beyond the hilt to the gnarled paw below, carving it in two in a fearsome spray of sparks and blood. The vile audience looked on in astonishment as she pressed the attack, driving her blade through her foe's flesh into the stampeding heart within. With a scream that split the clouds above, the beast erupted in a torrent of gore and anguish. The stygian portal wavered, the power sustaining the chasm beyond vanishing as suddenly as it had appeared. The remaining invaders fell quickly to Stonehall steel.
Though victorious, the survivors saw little to celebrate: the city lay in ruins, and survivors were few. Fires continued to spread. Unfurling her banners of war, Tresdin gathered what allies she could. Her anger smoldered as she pledged brutal vengeance upon the forces of the abyss, and damned be any who would dare stand in her way."

By this ageless crucible the star that mortals would come to call Phoenix collapsed into being, and like its ancestors was thrust into an endless cosmos to find a place among its stellar brethren. Yet curiosity toward that which the dimming elders comfort in the darkness consumed the fledgling, and so over long cycles it inquired and studied. It learned that among worlds both whole and broken would soon stir a nexus of remarkable variety locked in an enduring conflict of cosmic consequence, a plane which would find itself in need of more influence than a dying sun's distant rays could provide.

		"npc_dota_hero_oracle_bio"											"Ascendants to the Great Seat of Cymurri had for ages imported their Oracles exclusively from the Ivory Incubarium, high in the hollow peaks of the Zealot's Range, with a downpayment made at the time of the embryo's conception and the balance surrendered on delivery of a mature, well-trained prophet to the Gate of the Graven King.
Raised by same Pallid Sybils who bred and birthed them, all sanctioned Oracles were anchored by their physical form to the world we most of us share; meanwhile, their souls roamed far afield, barely bound by the airiest astral umbilicus. From such cosmic roamings the prophets would return, speaking words of fire with tongues of flesh. Their mystic utterances were analyzed by the Cymurri Advisors, who found in them visions of the future, diplomatic advice, all the supernatural ammunition the line of Graven Kings needed to secure victory in every campaign, whether in the court or on the battlefield. Thus it went for generations, the Graventome's pages filling with the names of triumphant kings and the new domains they had acquired. So it went, that is, until the particular Oracle named Nerif arrived to serve the very last of the stone-helmed kings. 
From the first, Nerif's prophecies were unusual. They seemed not merely to portend the future, but to shape it. The weird soothsayer croaked out advice no one had requested, and suddenly the Cymurri found themselves immersed in conflicts with newfound enemies. The Advisors, sensing a threat to their power, were quick to pin these unwelcome developments on the latest Oracle. They demanded his removal, petitioning the Sybils to reclaim their defective prophet and replace him with a worthy substitute. But Nerif described an ominous dream of the Incubarium's destruction, and within hours came news of the ancient school's destruction in a catastrophic avalanche. Fearing the same fate as the Pallid Sybils, the Advisors withdrew to their counsel chambers, suddenly anxious to avoid the Oracle's notice. 
The Graven King, however, was a creature of great practicality. He doubted the commitment of his overprudent Advisors. An Oracle of such rarity, he reasoned, ought be used as a weapon to enlarge his domain. He therefore demoted his timid counselors and stationed Nerif at his side. With only a blunt understanding of Nerif's talent, he boldly stated the outcomes he desired, and coaxed Nerif into uttering his wishes as prophecy. 
At first, all was well. The Last Graven King boasted that by adopting Fate's pet, he had made a plaything of Fate itself. He should have taken it as a warning then when, on the eve of his invasion of the Unsated Satrap's realm, he attempted to coerce a prediction of certain victory from his Oracle, only to hear Nerif quietly mutter, \"It could go either way.\" No firmer statement could he force from Nerif's lips. Still, the King was confident in his army. The Satrapy was landlocked, poorly armed, and shut off from all possible allies. He took \"It could go either way\" to indicate that with tactical might on his side, there was little risk in his plan.
Of course, we now know that he should have taken the sayer's words more literally. Even with careful study of the Annotated Annals of If, what happened on the field before the Unsated Satrap's palace is almost impossible to visualize. It appears that in the midst of the carnage, the battle began to bifurcate. At each pivotal moment, reality calved and broke into bits. Soldiers who staggered and fell in battle also stood sure-footed, forging onward to fight. Their minds also split; the warriors found themselves both dead and alive, existent and non-existent. Victory and defeat were partitioned, so that each separate outcome was experienced in simultaneity by both armies. The universe became a hall of mirrors, with all the mirrors endlessly shattering.
The immediate effect on both parties was insanity. Unable to comprehend the state of being both triumphant and defeated, the Graven King's mind dispersed into motes of madness. The naive Satrap fared no better. The opposing paired realities continued to split and split again, echoing into infinite histories, all of them populated by a bewildered populace that soon lost the ability to feed, clothe, defend, or reproduce itself in the traditional manner. 
Long before the repercussions had played out, however, Cymurri's wary Advisors had seized Nerif, bound and gagged him, and launched him out of their universe at high speed on a dimensional barque, in the hopes of depositing him where he could do them no harm forever. It was, of course, too late for them. And may well be for us."

Nor does Toterin. Or even Trapper Town. In fact, if one were to track the history of Techies Demolitions they might notice that shortly after Techies appear, towns tend to disappear.
Like every inevitable disaster surrounding Techies, the obliteration of Dredger's Bight began with an invention. Tasked with designing a safer way of detonating explosives in the mines beneath the city, pyrotechnic prodigies Squee, Spleen, and Spoon developed their most outlandish creation yet: a button which, when pressed, would trigger a distant device to spark a fuse.
Overeager to test their invention, the trio stuffed barrel after barrel with flamesalt explosives, piling every corner of their tiny workshop high with the newly developed remote bombs. From this stockpile they plucked a single payload, burying it in a far away field. As they cowered in a ditch, Spleen pressed the detonator button. Yet after a moment, nothing happened. Confused, he stood up, pressing his button again and again until, finally, an explosion tore a hole in the field. Elated, Squee and Spleen turned toward home just as a massive wave of sound and force arrived to knock them over.
Bewildered, their ears ringing from the unexpected blast, they gathered in the dingy miasma to see a smoking ruin where their workshop once stood. Chunks of wood and stone continued to fall as the yawning crater before them slowly deepened into an expanding pit. The whole of Dredger's Bight shuddered, and then gradually started to slide into the mines below as its panicked residents fled.
Sitting at the edge of their sinking home they grinned and giggled, as giddy at the possibilities as they were oblivious to the scorn of their former neighbors. They wondered only one thing: how could they trigger an even bigger blast?"

Auroth laments: \"We forget that there is more to life than triumph and dominion over enemies. We must also live our lives in the pursuit of creative expression.\" She embarks on research expeditions, collecting books for inspiration. But all this research can be terribly distracting, and she spends less time writing than she should. Although she knows she should be lurking in her lair, adding to the Eddas, she finds herself engaged in epic battles against powerful enemies. She loots castles, raids ancient libraries ... and if she happens to heap glory on herself in the process, she tells herself that it's merely a side effect of her research. The fact is, while her skill and power on the battlefield are legendary, her scholarly travails have thus far hardly been the stuff of literary acclaim.

Two among its greater fragments--who would come to be named Radiant and Dire--found themselves locked in vicious opposition, and began twisting all of creation to serve their conflict.<br><br>
As war and cataclysm threatened the nascent cosmos, the will of a third fragment made itself known. Naming itself Zet, this intellect sought to resolve the disharmony and return all to perfect unity. Appalled by its kin's conflicting nature, Zet gathered the sum of its power. In a sudden flash, it overwhelmed its siblings, and fused the warring aspects into a stellar sphere before hurling them into the darkness to orbit a nondescript world. Harmony was restored, though only the barest fraction of Zet's strength remained. Setting its gaze on the prison, Zet chose to use its weakened power to serve as watchful warden until time's end. For uncounted aeons, this vigil stood.<br><br>
Life flourished upon the world below, oblivious to the dangers imprisoned within the softly glowing moon, or of Zet's struggles to contain them. As the captives' eternal clash reverberated within, the surface of the prison shuddered, over time beginning to crack. Ultimately, Zet's depleted power proved insufficient to contain the breach, and at last the moon was shattered. The prison's ancient inhabitants had escaped to sow their conflict anew.<br><br>
Flung to the farthest reaches by the prison's explosion, Zet was transformed by the dissonant energies of its former captives. No longer of single form and thought, its presence had become split among many--some lesser, some greater--each connected by a fleeting arc of consciousness. Struggling to suppress its own disunity, Zet sped toward the burgeoning conflict of its siblings, bending its fractured wills toward a singular conclusion: the aspects of the primordial mind must be made to reunite, or all must be destroyed lest the conflict spread further..."

At the end of each day of The International, you'll have a time window in which you'll be able to adjust your roster, moving players on and off of your bench to change who you're fielding the following day.

		"DOTA_TIP_F_R_C_T"				"SCORING: CARRIES"

Their scoring formula is:\n\n0.3 points per kill\n0.2 Points deducted per death\n0.004 per last hit\n0.003 times their final gold per minute\n\nIf you take Black's recent performance against Alliance at Dreamhack (match #221209206), his final stats were 12 Kills, 1 Death, 545 Last Hits, and a final GPM of 877. This translates to a score of 8.2 points (3.6 points for kills, -.2 points for a single death, 2.1 points for last hits, and 2.6 points for his final GPM). This was a pretty impressive fantasy performance."
		"DOTA_TIP_F_R_M_T"				"SCORING: SOLOS"
		"DOTA_TIP_F_R_M_D"				"Solo players are mostly players that take solo mid during laning, with some exceptions for teams that have offlane semi-carries, or at least high farming heroes that don't play in the middle. These players score points for you by being active throughout the game, rather than having long periods of farming gold. Their scoring formula is:\n\n0.4 points per kill\n0.35 points deduced per death\n0.002 points per last hit\n0.002 times their final gold per minute\n0.003 times their final xp per minute\n\nIf we take a look at the top scoring match for a solo player at Dreamhack, Dendi's match (#220663853) where he had 16 kills, 1 death, 87 last hits, a final GPM of 646, and a final XPM of 702 comes out on top (6.4 for kills, -.35 for deaths, .17 for last hits, 1.3 for GPM, and 2.1 for XPM). His total score for that match was 9.6."
		"DOTA_TIP_F_R_S_T"				"SCORING: SUPPORTS"
		"DOTA_TIP_F_R_S_D"				"Support players have an emphasis on activity, like a Solo player, but with less on securing the kills themselves. One of the marks of a good support player in professional Dota is that they tend to “always get their levels”, so there is an emphasis on being involved and active throughout the game. Their scoring formula is:\n\n0.2 points per kill\n0.05 points deducted per death\n0.2 points per assist\n0.001 points per last hit\n0.001 times their final gold per minute\n0.004 times their final xp per minute\n\nDuring last year's International, QQQ played Chen and his stats at the end were 7 kills, 5 deaths, 28 assists, 150 last hits, 308 GPM, and 404 XPM, which would have netted you a total of 8.8 points if you had him on your team (1.4 for kills, -.25 for deaths, 5.6 for assists, .15 for last hits, .3 for GPM, 1.6 for XPM)."

		"DOTA_TIP_2013_MM_Blurb_0"		"The longest match of the West qualifiers, with Divine Rapiers on both teams. Rox.KIS focused on early pushing potential with a strong late game backup in Gyrocopter, while EG designed a mid game ganking lineup leading into Luna for the late game. With two of the best scaling late game carries, and two high impact mid players in Juggernaut and Magnus, it all came down to which team could control Roshan in order to protect their Divine Rapiers."
		"DOTA_TIP_2013_MM_Rad_0"		"Rox.KIS:\nBatrider - Solo Top\nJuggernaut - Solo Mid\nGyrocopter and Rubick - Bottom\nEnchantress - Jungling in the Dire Jungle\n\nRox.KIS controlled the early game, using the Juggernaut and Enchantress to push and destroy multiple Dire towers, then moving to secure an early Aegis from Roshan. Meanwhile, Rubick ensured Gyrocopter would get some farm bottom, and Batrider dominated the Magnus top, forcing Nyx to rotate top to help. In the mid game, EG turned it around, winning multiple team fights with Magnus, eventually pushing into the Radiant base. Team fights went back and forth in the mid to late game, culminating in multiple barracks being down for both teams. Late game, with multiple Roshan kills on the board, both Gyrocopter and Luna purchased Divine Rapiers to fight the final battle.\n\nEventually, Rox.KIS was able to secure victory at the 76 minute mark. Can you beat their time?"
		"DOTA_TIP_2013_MM_Dire_0"		"EG:\nMagnus - Solo Top\nNightstalker - Solo Mid\nNyx Assassin, Shadow Demon and Luna - Bottom\n\nNightstalker struggled mid against a Juggernaut that used Blade Fury liberally, and Magnus could only control its lane once Nyx Assassin rotated top to assist him. On the plus side, Shadow Demon proved crucial in the early game, netting 2 kills with Luna in the Bottom lane.\nNight time allowed EG to regain control with Nightstalker, Nyx Assassin and Shadow Demon finding some kills, and that created space for Luna to catch up to Gyrocopter. Even though Rox.KIS pushed hard with Juggernaut and Enchantress, EG was able to use Magnus's Reverse Polarity to win several teamfights, even getting to break into Rox.KIS' base. Late game, with multiple Roshan kills on the board, both Gyrocopter and Luna purchase Divine Rapiers to fight the final battle.\n\nEventually, Rox.KIS was able to secure victory at the 76 minute mark. Can you change history, and win instead?"
		"DOTA_TIP_2013_MM_Blurb_1"		"With Lone Druid and Lifestealer dominating the scene, DD brought 3 very unconventional solutions to the problem: A weaver that can kite the Lifestealer forever, a Razor that can absorb the bear and Lifestealer's damage, and a Treant to make sure no lane feels threatened. Will it be enough?"
		"DOTA_TIP_2013_MM_Rad_1"        "Mouz used the following lanes:\nLone Druid Solo Bottom\nJuggernaut Solo Mid\nKeeper of the Light and Rubick supporting Lifestealer Top\nMouz quickly found out that they had little kill potential in their lanes, but with some good bottle crowing and the right positioning, they were still able to find farm there. Razor's static link proved annoying to Lone Druid, forcing him to resort to pulling and occasionally jungling. Attempts at killing the top trilane failed as the combination of Weaver's shukuchi, living armor and nightmare were enough to stop any aggression and even get some counter kills. Once mid game arrived, Mouz knew they had to burst heroes down fast because DD's lineup was built around highly sustainable heroes, and while they succeeded for a while, a few unfavourable fights put them too far behind to come back successfully, and DD took the game."
		"DOTA_TIP_2013_MM_Dire_1"       "DD used the following lanes:\nRazor Solo Bottom\nQueen of Pain Solo Mid\nBane, Treant Protector and Weaver Top\nDD planned on utilising Razor's static link to impede Lone Druid's farm in the bottom lane, while Weaver farmed against the Lifestealer in top, using Weaver's innate mobility and the support of Treant and Bane to ensure he could win the lane. That plan succeeded, while Queen of Pain also managed to earn a lot of farm against Juggernaut in the middle. Once Bane and Queen of Pain reached level 6, they started to roam and gank Lifestealer and Lone Druid. From midgame and onwards, DD's goal was to extend teamfights as much as possible, with Razor and Weaver being very good at sustained damage, Bane and Treant being good at keeping people alive, and Queen of Pain being good at cleanup. In the end, DD controlled the game and slowly sieged mouz's base to claim victory."
		"DOTA_TIP_2013_MM_Blurb_2"		"Yes, Dire gets Magnus, Lifestealer, Lone Druid, Nyx Assasin AND Keeper of the Light - arguably 5 of the 6 strongest picks when this game was played. But who cares when Radiant picks up Ursa? Can one of the most unusual lineups in recent times defeat 5 powerhouses?"
		"DOTA_TIP_2013_MM_Rad_2"        "Empire:\nGyrocopter - Solo Bottom\nPuck - Solo Mid\nShadow Demon, Leshrac and Ursa - Top\n\nEven with an Ursa, Empire isn't able to go for a level 1 Roshan because they're on Radiant, so everyone moves to their lanes instead. Gyrocopter manages to dominate against the Lone Druid in bottom lane, while Puck controls Magnus effectively in the mid. Top lane has trouble executing the Disruption->Split Earth combo because DD's supports position themselves well. Puck gets 2 solo kills, which allows her to get a quick level 6 and start transitioning into ganking the Lone Druid, helping Gyrocopter stay ahead. Unfortunately, it all went downhill in the mid game, with Empire's supports repeatedly dying. Unable to win a single teamfight, they tapped out at 23 mins. Can you survive longer, or perhaps even win?"
		"DOTA_TIP_2013_MM_Dire_2"       "DD:\nLone Druid - Solo Bottom\nMagnus - Solo Mid\nNyx Assassin, Keeper of the Light and Lifestealer - Top\n\nDD knew that their lineup was really strong in the mid game, and all they needed to do was to ensure they wouldn't give away too many kills beforehand, especially in the Trilane vs. Trilane and the Magnus vs Puck matchup. While they lose a couple of early engagements, DD manages to control their trilane to the point where Empire was forced to rotate more heroes in to help, which gave enough room for Lone Druid and Magnus to quickly catch up. During the mid game, DD's execution was perfect, and after winning 3 consecutive teamfights, they secured the GG in an early 23 minutes. Can you reproduce their success?"
		"DOTA_TIP_2013_MM_Blurb_3"		"Slark and Enigma bring something unconventional to the strong Lone Druid and Lifestealer combination for AL, while Rox.KIS went for a very risky strategy. The Lycan has to split push fast, but he won't need a BKB, and if problems arise, Keeper can bring him to the fight where Omniknight will provide him all the magic immunity he needs. Can you execute it properly?"
		"DOTA_TIP_2013_MM_Rad_3"        "Absolute Legends used the following lanes:\nLone Druid - Solo Bottom\nSlark - Solo Mid\nEnigma - Radiant Jungle\nLina and Lifestealer - Top\n\nAbsolute Legends' plan was for Slark and Enigma to quickly reach level 6, after which they can roam for pickoffs while the Lone Druid and Lifestealer farm their items. Fortune was on aL's side, as they get an early kill in their offensive dual vs trilane scenario, and quickly follow it up with a kill in the mid lane. That allowed Enigma to be able to farm the jungle faster without needing to help in the lanes. 8 minutes into the game, aL took two towers and led 8-0 in kills. While ROX.Kis managed to win 2 teamfights, going slightly in their favor, the game got out of control afterwards. Absolute Legends destroyed all tier 2 towers at the 16 minute mark, took barracks at 20, and won at 26. Can you do the same?"
		"DOTA_TIP_2013_MM_Dire_3"       "Rox.KIS used the following lanes:\nJuggernaut - Solo Bottom\nOmniknight - Solo Mid\nNyx Assassin, Keeper of the Light and Lycan - Top\n\nRox.KIS's goal with this lineup was to get fast levels on Omniknight and Juggernaut, and farm the Lycan so that he can go for damage items, since he won't need a BKB. Unfortunately the plan failed early on, as Omniknight and Lycan were both killed early into the game, and that allowed Absolute Legends to gain map control with Slark. At about 10 minutes into the game, Rox.KIS was able to properly capitalize on the burst damage potential of their lineup, getting a few kills, but it went downhill from there. After losing barracks at the 20 minute mark, they called GG a short time afterwards. Can you keep your Omniknight and Lycan alive, and avoid their fate?"
		"DOTA_TIP_2013_MM_Blurb_4"		"Doom is back! What seemed like a very unfavourable matchup against Queen of Pain turned into pure domination from Rattlesnake. Will history repeat itself?"
		"DOTA_TIP_2013_MM_Rad_4"        "Dreamz used the following lanes:\nAlchemist - Solo Bottom\nQueen of Pain - Solo Mid\nShadow Demon and Lina supporting Weaver - Top\n\nThe goal for Dreamz was to win mid lane vs Doom, while getting farm on the Alchemist against Rattlesnake's offlaner. Their hope was that Weaver would survive in the hard lane, and allow the 2 supports to roam. However, the Silencer proved very dangerous for the Weaver, which forced the supports to stay in the lane. MeanWhile, Queen of Pain got a kill on doom when she hit level 6. Once Doom and Silencer reached level 6, it became nearly impossible for Dreamz to take any full 5 on 5 fight, as Global Silence and Doom proved very difficult to deal with for both Queen of Pain and Weaver. Not finding any pickoffs, they were forced to take teamfights, which led to a slow but inevitable defeat 33 minutes into the game. Can you avoid unfavorable teamfights and change the outcome?"
		"DOTA_TIP_2013_MM_Dire_4"       "Rattlesnake used the following lanes:\nDark seer and Clockwerk - Bottom\nDoom - Solo Mid\nSilencer and Gyrocopter - Top\n\nKnowing he'd have trouble mid, Doom waited for the first neutral spawn before going to the lane. He found a Satyr Hellcaster, whose regen helped him a lot against Queen of Pain's early harass. The Silencer repeatedly harassed the Weaver with Last Word, making it very hard for Weaver to play safe, and that gave allowed Gyrocopter to farm easily. Once Doom and Silencer hit level 6, most of Dreamz heroes were rendered useless. Doom went for the racecar build (Phase Boots, Drums, and Shadow Blade), and that allowed him to find a number of pick offs. Eventually Rattlesnake grouped as 5, and slowly but surely sieged the Radiant base, until Dreamz called the GG at the 33 minute mark. Can you reproduce their victory?"
		"DOTA_TIP_2013_MM_Blurb_5"		"Sven and Leshrac have been laning together since early Dota, and when you add Visage, you have a terrific trilane. On the other side, we have a greedy lineup relying on Weaver's ability to farm, and the initiation powers of Magnus and Clockwerk. Will Keeper of the Light hold off long enough for his farm intensive team to hit its stride?"
		"DOTA_TIP_2013_MM_Rad_5"        "Rising Stars used the following lanes:\nWeaver - Solo Bottom\nMagnus - Solo Mid\nClockwerk - Top\nDark Seer and Keeper of the Light - Jungle\n\nWith four farming heroes in their lineup, Rising Stars objective was to get quick levels. Then they'd use their huge teamfight potential during the mid game by combining Vacuum, Wall, Cogs and Reverse Polarity. However, Magnus had a hard time keeping up to Queen of Pain's pace, the Weaver gave away first blood to VG's trilane, and a failed gank attempt on Lone Druid by Dark Seer gave away a free kill. At 17 minutes, Vici Gaming got their first Roshan, and Rising Stars started losing control of the game. Even thought they got some kills, the need for their lineup to be in the middle of the action cost them more than they could get. While the lineup is good enough to hold off for 40 minutes, even at a disadvantage, eventually Vici Gaming wins a decisive fight and takes the game."
		"DOTA_TIP_2013_MM_Dire_5"       "Vici Gaming used the following lanes:\nLone Druid - Solo Top\nQueen of Pain - Solo Mid\nVisage, Leshrac and Sven - Bottom\n\nQueen of Pain controlled the Mid lane, and Lone Druid was able to fend off Clockwerk and Dark Seer by means of a few lucky entangles and good support rotations. After the trilane secured an early kill on Weaver, they left Sven to solo against the Weaver, allowing Leshrac and Visage to roam. The sheer burst power of Queen of Pain combined with Leshrac and Visage allowed Vici Gaming to gain control of the early game, and take their first Roshan at 17 minutes. Once in control, they chose not to rush, instead focusing on controlling the map and getting ahead in farm. After taking a second Roshan at 28 minutes, they waited for Rising Stars to make a mistake. Finally, at 40 minutes in, where the gold and xp advantages were enough for Vici Gaming to overwhelm Rising Stars with brute force, they were able to win a decisive fight and claim victory."

		"Comp_223_PG_lumi_1textcustom3_text"   "One of the more impressive feats in Dota is re-inventing a 10 year old game. In Dreamleague's opening match of Navi vs Fnatic, N0tail played Meepo as a support, something that has never been done before. While other supports can pressure lanes, none can do so at a global scale, all the while maintaining steady experience and gold gain. N0tail displayed an impressive Meepo game full of roaming, ganking and Blink Dagger initiating. With Meepo being such a rare pick, it's unlikely that other teams will experiment with support Meepo; however, this game gives a glimpse what the hero is truly capable of."

		"Comp_223_PG_lumi_2textcustom3_text"   "In Week 2's Fnatic vs Team Liquid match up, we get to see Axe played in a competitive environment. This game does an excellent job in showcasing Axe's strengths and weaknesses. Early on, Bulba's Axe was able to maraude through the map and find kills despite diving into 2 or 3 of Fnatic's heroes. However, due to Axe's weak scaling, as mid/late game rolled around, Axe's effectiveness fell off quickly. This is one of the few interesting case study of Axe, and it deserves a look for any Axe fans."
		"Comp_223_PG_lumi_3textcustom1_text"   "Sigma - Rox.KIS: Remake pls!"
		"Comp_223_PG_lumi_3textcustom3_text"   "Disregarding the controversies that surrounded the game, Sigma vs Rox.kis is one of the most unique games in Dota history. Rox.kis started out the game strong by securing multiple outer towers and Roshan, and came knocking with a pre-20 minute rax push. Up against an insanely farmed Lycan and Nature's Prophet, itemless Shadow Fiend and Slardar were Sigma's cores. What came after this point was a series of the most amazing defenses I have ever witness as a Dota caster. Fata's Shadow Fiend was, as Draskyl pointed out, the embodiment of Power, utilizing one of the most creative Shadow Fiend item build ever. Though Fata is not the Dreamleague MVP during week 3, he's won me over in this game. A must watch."

		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon1textcustom1_text"   "Interview With The Red Moon Workshop pt. 1"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon1textcustom2_text"   "The ESL One Frankfurt Compendium just hit the Dota 2 in-game store, with the Red Moon Workshop having created some amazing items for it. We got in touch and asked them a few questions about their work and the life of a workshop artist."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon1textcustom3_text"   "ESL: Hello, guys - could you introduce yourself to us for those who don't already know you?"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon1textcustom4_text"   "Bounch: Hi! I'm Bounch. I'm the 3D artist for Red Moon. My primary job here is to encourage Andrew's crazy ideas and to make sure Oroboros develops a nervous twitch from the concept feedback I give him. Really, though, I build the cosmetics in 3D and paint them up for use in the game. It's a tough but rewarding practice."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon1textcustom5_text"   "Oroboros: Hello, I'm Oroboros and I'm the dedicated 2D artist for Red Moon, along with a half dozen other tasks (marketing, talking to clients, taking care of the social aspects of Red Moon). My primary job is to drive Bounch crazy with overly detailed concepts that exceed poly limits and convince Andrew to commit to impossible SFM projects."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon1textcustom6_text"   "Andrew: I'm Andrew Helenek, animator of Red Moon Workshop."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon2textcustom1_text"   "Interview With The Red Moon Workshop pt. 2"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon2textcustom2_text"   "ESL: How did you all meet?"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon2textcustom3_text"   "Bounch: I can field this one. It starts with Polycount. We were all members of the website and had each individually decided to attempt making cosmetics. I had done one with a close friend for the Polycount contest in December 2012 and really enjoyed making art for a game I really enjoyed, so I decided to continue doing more, looking for more people to collab with."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon2textcustom4_text"   "Through a friend of the site I was introduced to Oroboros, hearing that he was looking for someone to work with for the 3D side. After talking, we decided I would do the Lycan set he had originally concepted for the Polycount contest. We managed to finish without hating each other at the end so we decided to work together more. During all of this, I had gone to the GDC Polycount party (yes, lots of Polycount here, haha) and while I was sitting at the bar I found myself in conversation with someone that was also involved in Dota 2 cosmetics along with his friend Andrew."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon2textcustom5_text"   "I went over to the table where Andrew was sitting and introduced myself, letting him know how much of a fan I was of Cluckles. He responded kindly saying that he really liked the Phantom Lancer set I had done for the contest, which got us to talking about a future collaboration. It seemed obvious enough to me at that point to combine our skill sets, introduce Andrew and Oroboros, and wreak some havoc together."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon2textcustom6_text"   "Oroboros: Primarily out of frustration. I was trying to break into the Dota 2 scene but was unable to find a reliable modeler to bring my concepts to life. One after the other they'd disappear halfway through the process, which made me wonder if I'd ever find a reliable partner. I happened to be working at the same company as the head of Polycount, who heard out my frustrations and amicably introduced me to Bounch and the Polycount community. Following a few months of collaboration with Bounch, I was also introduced to Andrew, who came in to address our animation needs."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon3textcustom1_text"   "Interview With The Red Moon Workshop pt. 3"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon3textcustom2_text"   "ESL: What did you all do before you started work as workshop artists and what made you decide to go full time?"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon3textcustom3_text"   "Bounch: I've been in the game industry as a 3D artist since 2007. After dabbling in the workshop first hand for close to a year, I decided I was having way too much fun to only be doing it part time. It was all I thought about. That, and it was really tough to constantly be doing 16 hour days for so long… though to be fair that hasn't changed as of yet."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon3textcustom4_text"   "Oroboros: I worked in the game industry for six years or so, with my last job being at Sony working on a next gen project that unfortunately got canceled. Following the end of that project, I decided to give full-time Dota 2 workshop a shot as the freedom it offered from a typical 9-5 job was undeniable. I'd been following Valve's workshop scene since TF2 but missed that boat. I wasn't going to take chances this time!"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon3textcustom5_text"   "Andrew: I was a student, believe it or not. It was my senior year of college and I constantly faced the looming worry of &quot;what do I do once I'm out of academia?&quot; Conveniently, with all that extra time on my hands, I put it all into the workshop, and, needless to say, it paid off. As far as me going full time, it just happened naturally - there was never a moment where I made a decision to go full time."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon4textcustom1_text"   "Interview With The Red Moon Workshop pt. 4"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon4textcustom2_text"   "ESL: Could you describe the content creation process for an item a bit?"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon4textcustom3_text"   "Oroboros: I come in at the beginning, middle and end of the process typically. I typically try to come up with a tidbit of lore for each item before starting the concepting process. When a concept feels good, it typically goes to Bounch and we usually have a feedback phase where I get a chance to do paintovers of the model in its WIP state. When the model is completed, I typically collaborate with Andrew and Bounch to pose the set and get a Marmoset render for illustrations and other marketing materials."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon4textcustom4_text"   "Bounch: Once Oroboros feels confident in his design of the current item, he then passes it off to me. I do slight revisions based on the triangle budget we have available to make it with then start off with the modeling. My primary programs for this phase are Maya and Zbrush, to block out and then detail the model respectively. Once I'm happy with how the high resolution sculpt looks, I take it into a program such as TopoGun or Maya to create the game resolution mesh."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon4textcustom5_text"   "This can sometimes be difficult due to the polygon limitations imposed by the game engine, but with enough thought and some trickery we can make most things work without going too insane. After this mesh is made, I then paint it up using Photoshop and 3D Coat before rigging and previewing in the game. If it's a ward or courier, I will pass off the mesh before I start texturing so Andrew can begin his process of bringing it to life."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon4textcustom6_text"   "Andrew: Covering just my end, the animation side of things. Once Bounch sends me a 3D model, I put bones inside it and create controls to influence those bones. Think of it like a virtual puppet, and I'm its puppeteer creating the illusion of life. But before I animate it, I make sure to find some reference, something from the real world I can use to base the animations off of to make them more relatable and grounded. After I finished the animations, I start testing everything in the game, making sure it works as intended. I get some final critiques from other artists, apply any feedback, polish everything up then finalize and ship it to the workshop."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon5textcustom1_text"   "Interview With The Red Moon Workshop pt. 5"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon5textcustom2_text"   "ESL: Can you take us through the day in your life?"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon5textcustom3_text"   "Bounch: Haha, right now? This might be a bit boring of an answer, but it usually consists of waking up, working, taking a small break for food, maybe playing a game of Dota or CS:GO, working, and then going back to sleep to repeat it all tomorrow. I must say it does feel a bit strange waking up right when the sun is going down sometimes, but right now it's all about getting cosmetics done so the players have cool stuff to use in game. I'm hoping to make more time in the future to pursue my traditional art and music interests but for now Dota has a firm grip on me."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon5textcustom4_text"   "Oroboros: At the moment it's an absolute seesaw, but the average day so far starts late in the afternoon and goes till early morning. We've been working with so many international organizations that it's become necessary to stay up late to keep the communication channels open and our clients happy. I typically reserve a few hours to spend time with my family and get some exercise before heading over to the office to spend a day cranking out concepts. During breaks we try to get outside and enjoy Austin (when we can) and play CS:GO or Dota."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon5textcustom5_text"   "Andrew: It's hard to define a day. The only constant is that I animate whenever I'm awake while taking breaks to play whatever video game everyone else is playing at the moment. I don't really do anything else outside of that - I live and breathe my work."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon6textcustom1_text"   "Interview With The Red Moon Workshop pt. 6"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon6textcustom2_text"   "ESL: How do you guys come up with the ideas for the content you create? Do you have any specific inspiration sources?"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon6textcustom3_text"   "Bounch: For me it's a bit easier since I'm usually fed concepts, but I have ideas too, you know! A lot of my inspiration comes from places like Polycount, CGHub (RIP) and lately Pintrest thanks to the way you can sort and browse through reference that's already been gathered and manicured by people looking for the same type of inspiration. Someone even made a board specifically for Dota reference:"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon6textcustom4_text"   "http://www.pinterest.com/bunnyparty/dota-2-workshop-inspiration/"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon6textcustom5_text"   "Classic fantasy art such as Frank Frazetta also gives my creative energy a nice boost in a positive direction when I need it."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon6textcustom6_text"   "Oroboros: I'm constantly buying art books, browsing websites like Tumblr, Pinterest, deviantART or any other art website I can use to keep myself visually 'fueled' and fresh. Also, referencing lore and browsing existing workshop submissions for heroes is a fun way to get the juices flowing. I spend a lot of time on the Dota 2 wiki."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon6textcustom7_text"   "Andrew: Anywhere and everywhere. I find that my best inspiration and ideas come from when I separate myself from the world and simply shut my brain off."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon7textcustom1_text"   "Interview With The Red Moon Workshop pt. 7"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon7textcustom2_text"   "ESL: Who has or claims to have the toughest job among you?"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon7textcustom3_text"   "Bounch: I think each of us would make that claim. Though to be honest, it's always going to change depending on what we're working on at the time. No part of the process can really be considered ‘easy', and we all respect each other's talents. Except for Andrew - I'm pretty sure he thinks he's the king."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon7textcustom4_text"   "Andrew: Hahaha, we all have our own difficulties when dealing with the workshop - it's never a smooth process, but the lack of animation guidelines in general makes my job even more difficult."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon7textcustom5_text"   "Oroboros: It really depends on the project and client. Every step of the 'chain' in our process comes with its own set of very unique challenges. My main job is to deliver a design that the community will love, which has been a learning experience all its own."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon8textcustom1_text"   "Interview With The Red Moon Workshop pt. 8"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon8textcustom2_text"   "ESL: The ESL One Frankfurt Lifestealer set received responses from the community both positive as well as critical. How does community feedback impact the design/creation process?"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon8textcustom3_text"   "Bounch: Community feedback can affect the result quite a lot, but it's a difficult line to draw sometimes since everyone has their own opinions on what's good or not. We take everything into consideration when sharing things publicly for feedback, but we have to be picky on what we implement, not only for aesthetic value but to make sure it is feasible to achieve in game."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon8textcustom4_text"   "Oroboros: It's all about the community - we always submit our stuff to social channels to get feedback. I'm always gauging reactions on items we release, and apply the feedback in the hope of making our current or next creation better. Sometimes we have to take things with a grain of salt as it's easy to be swayed by a vocal few over the silent majority."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon8textcustom5_text"   "Andrew: It's hard to judge. Most of the time, the feedback you receive will be one of two things, with a very small minority offering anything you can directly use. You create something they don't like, you get a Reddit post saying don't implement this and it gets flamed into the ground, or you create something they do like and you get ASCII spammed."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon8textcustom6_text"   "It's less about community feedback and more about studying the trends of which items are loved and which are hated and using that data to your advantage to create something players want. There are always exceptions, but that's usually the case more times than not."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon9textcustom1_text"   "Interview With The Red Moon Workshop pt. 9"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon9textcustom2_text"   "ESL: Next to item creation, you also have to come up with a bit of lore around it. Do you base this of existing lore in Dota 2 or do you look elsewhere?"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon9textcustom3_text"   "Bounch: I get most of my ideas for lore from what's available on the Dota 2 main website, and an awesome thread on dev.dota2 that has breakdowns of every hero and their relationship with the world and other heroes. It's a great resource and I've learned a ton - it's honestly really fun to see how fleshed out the universe feels, at least considering my original expectations for a game like this. Unfortunately it seems Valve has decided to remove the lore snippets from the store, though I'm hoping it's only temporary."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon9textcustom4_text"   "Oroboros: It's all about spinning off existing lore! I rarely deviate from Valve's lore, as there's plenty to go off. We always try to tie our submissions to locations and backstory provided by Valve and the community."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon9textcustom5_text"   "Andrew: There is a fantastic mega thread on the dev.dota2 which provides everything about the lore for just about anything. While we do look elsewhere, we usually make sure it makes sense in relation to the big picture in which the Dota universe exists."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon10textcustom1_text"   "Interview With The Red Moon Workshop pt. 10"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon10textcustom2_text"   "ESL: What's your own favorite item to have worked on or created and which one is your favorite in the entire workshop?"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon10textcustom3_text"   "Bounch: My favorite item I have done is probably our Red Panda “Snaggletooth” courier we did last year. He's not in yet, but we have our fingers crossed for some day soon! I also quite like our ward “Omij, the Sentinel of Knowledge” and still have a soft spot for my first set, “Ancestor's Pride” for Phantom Lancer."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon10textcustom4_text"   "There are SO many excellent entries that I couldn't pick a single favorite. A few standouts for me though are DonDon's “Father of Dragons” Dragon Knight set, Oni/Zaphk's “Blessings of the Eternal Eclipse” Luna set, and Motenai's “Jewels of the Teardrop Ice” Phantom Lancer set. Again, there's tons of fantastic stuff out there and I encourage everyone to explore the workshop because you never know what treasure you might find off the front page. Remember to vote!"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon10textcustom5_text"   "Oroboros: In terms of an item we worked on, there's a few but the Snaggletooth courier is probably my favorite one yet. The concept just came together seamlessly, we had plenty of time to spend on it and everyone just loved it. As for a set someone else created, the Twin Blades set for Bounty Hunter by Motenai and Vidotto, which hasn't gone in yet unfortunately. Honestly, though, there's so much good stuff waiting to go in from a ton of talented artists that it kind of blows my mind. Too many pending submissions to count."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon10textcustom6_text"   "Andrew: My own? Easily Cluckles the Brave, it was more or less my introduction to the workshop and the reason why I'm where I am today. As far as in the whole workshop, that's impossible to answer, there are way too many submissions that are absolutely fantastic and it would be an injustice to pick out just one."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon11textcustom1_text"   "Interview With The Red Moon Workshop pt. 11"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon11textcustom2_text"   "ESL: What would your best advice be to people looking to start creating items themselves?"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon11textcustom3_text"   "Bounch: I would say first to decide what you think you'd enjoy doing most. Learn as much as you can about the subject you decide to pursue and surround yourself with it. There are lots of great learning resources on the internet such as Polycount, Eat 3D, 3dmotive, and Gnomon Workshop. Regardless of which you choose, you can't go wrong with drawing every day."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon11textcustom4_text"   "Oroboros: Figure out ahead of time if you're going to treat it like a hobby or something more serious. Go to Polycount, surround yourself with like-minded creators and do your best. Don't give up after the first submission, expect a wait to get that first item in. It's kind of a tough, ever-evolving scene to break into, but I've learned that persistence pays off eventually."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon11textcustom5_text"   "Andrew: Become insane, haha. Consistently doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result is the only reason I achieved anything. More specific advice, jump on Polycount, search tutorials on YouTube, anything that can advance your skills is what you need to do better yourself. Make sure you find time every day to put into it, whether it's an hour or a whole day - it's way better than nothing."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon12textcustom1_text"   "Interview With The Red Moon Workshop pt. 12"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon12textcustom2_text"   "ESL: Is there anything you'd like to say to all the fans of your work or the new ones you've just gained?"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon12textcustom3_text"   "Bounch: I just want to say thanks to everyone for supporting the workshop and making all of this possible. It's an incredible new avenue for people to interact and get involved with the game, and for us to be able to contribute content to something we love and see people get enjoyment out of it is an absolute dream. Thank you so much!"
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon12textcustom4_text"   "Oroboros: Thank you to the community for supporting us throughout this interesting journey into uncharted waters. I'd also like to make a plea to anyone reading this to dig a little deeper into the workshop to find fresh submissions from other talented creators and show them your support."
		"Comp_1248_PG_redmoon12textcustom5_text"   "It's not all about the front page and the top three - there's a ton of really cool work that goes unnoticed, which has always bugged me. And more than anything thanks to Polycount for putting us on the correct path and the helpful artists and individuals who have offered advice and guidance along the way."
